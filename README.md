# NameMatcher

A high-performance Java application to search for a predefined list of names within a large text file using the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm and Java 21 Virtual Threads.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an efficient multi-threaded name search pipeline that leverages:

* **Aho-Corasick algorithm** for multi-pattern matching.
* **Java 21 Virtual Threads** to process large files in parallel with minimal memory overhead.
* **Chunked file reading** to avoid loading large files entirely into memory.

The program outputs each found name along with its exact character offset and line offset in the text.

## âœ… How It Works

1. **Build the Trie:**
   The list of names is read from `dictionary.txt` and compiled into a case-insensitive Aho-Corasick Trie.

2. **Chunked File Reading:**
   The large file (`big.txt`) is read in chunks of 1000 lines at a time.

3. **Parallel Matching with Virtual Threads:**
   Each chunk is submitted to a virtual thread that uses the compiled matcher to find all name occurrences.

4. **Result Aggregation:**
   Results from each chunk are collected, deduplicated, and aggregated using `MatchesAggregator`.

5. **Output:**
   Each matched name is printed in the format:

   ```
   ```

Name --> \[\[lineOffset=..., charOffset=...], ...]

```

## ðŸ§ª Example Output
```

James --> \[\[lineOffset=1200, charOffset=25480], \[lineOffset=3567, charOffset=75320]]
John --> \[\[lineOffset=134, charOffset=1987], \[lineOffset=856, charOffset=15234]]

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Place your `dictionary.txt` and `big.txt` in the `resources/` directory.

2. Compile and run using Java 21:
```bash
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
java -cp out:resources NameParser
````

3. Output will be printed to `stdout`.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes on Design

* Uses **Virtual Threads** (Java 21) to process many chunks concurrently with very low memory overhead.
* Designed to **avoid OutOfMemoryErrors** by never loading the entire file into memory.
* Custom **Aho-Corasick** implementation avoids dependency bloat.
* Output is sorted by match and location.
